Recursion:
    when a function calls itself until a base condition is met.
    It basically means breaking thing into smaller things.

If a base conditionis not there then there will be a segmentation fault 
commonly called stack overflow.

It is  because the intital function will wait in the stack and call another
function and it will continue for an infinite loop which will cause stack
overflow.
